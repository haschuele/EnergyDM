# Energy Decision-Making Tool

While heat stress exposure urges Utilities management to provide extra energy supply to support AC usage, wildfire risk points them to induce planned power outages so that fire ignition due to grid failure is prevented. The aim of this decision-making tool is to help Energy Utilities decide how to distribute energy and where to apply planned outages according to community vulnerabilities.

My individual contribution during this internship, including [code]() and a final [writeup](), was to explore forecasting and decision-making approaches. The team's final poster can be seen [here](). 

This project was conducted as an internship with Climformatics during Fall 2023.
